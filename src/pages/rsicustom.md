**Relative Strength Index (RSI)** - A momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Commonly, RSI is calculated over the 14 prior price changes but may be requested of more or fewer samples. By default, our Custom Column app looks at the prior 14 closes for the sampling, but the number of samples can be sent in as a parameter.

For information on our pricing and our support policies, please visit our [pricing](/pricing/) and [support](/support/) pages.

Once the RSI Custom app is obtained from [Imagine's IFP Marketplace](http://marketplace.derivatives.com/collections/vendors?q=Scouras+Consulting "Imagine's IFP Marketplace"), set up your Custom Columns as shown below. If you're using a 14 day RSI, there is no need for parameters:
